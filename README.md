</p>

What do I mean by "more"? Here's exactly what I've made extensive use of:

 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 - [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
 - [Realm](https://realm.io/)
 - [EasyAdapter](https://github.com/ribot/easy-adapter)
 - [Kotter Knife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/kotterknife)
 - [Material DateTime Picker](https://github.com/wdullaer/MaterialDateTimePicker)
 - [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/)
 - [Android-Crop](https://github.com/jdamcd/android-crop)

I used this great project, [Android Boilerplate](https://github.com/hitherejoe/Android-Boilerplate), as a reference.

I had been looking for something like this myself and couldn't find one. So, if you were like me, I hope you learn something from this!

Requirements
------------
 - [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
 - Android SDK Build tools 23.0.3
 - Android Support Repository and Library
 - Gradle Plugin 2.1.0
 
Building
--------
The easiest way to setup this project is to simply open it with Android Studio, like you would any other project.
 
However, if you don't want to import it, you can run this from the root of the project to build, install and run:

    ./gradlew installRunDebug

Possible Upcoming Features
--------
 - Unit Tests
 - Automated Tests

*I need to write some tests*
